# Fibonacci
In this program, the user is prompted to enter the number of elements in the Fibonacci series. The program then uses a loop to generate and print the Fibonacci series.

We start by initializing the variables first and second to 0 and 1, respectively. These represent the first two elements of the Fibonacci series.

We then print the first two elements using System.out.print(first + " " + second + " ");.

Next, we use a loop that starts from 3 and goes up to numElements. In each iteration, we calculate the next element by adding first and second, and then print it using System.out.print(next + " ");.

After printing each element, we update the values of first and second for the next iteration. This is done by assigning second to first and next to second.

By the end of the program, the Fibonacci series with the specified number of elements will be printed on the console.
